# Nonlinear Regression

* tokyo2018.csv and tokyo2019.csv are daily averages of temperature at Tokyo in Jan. - Dec. 2018 and Jan. - Feb. 2019. These are referenced from [Japan Meteorological Agency](https://www.jma.go.jp/).

**Data should be assumed as described below.**

1. Actual data has some cyclical pattern. In this case, tokyo2018.csv is assumed to have at least one cycle because of Spring to Winter seasonal cycle.

2. Actual data should be assumed to predict the future in view of its own cycle.

3. Actual data should be assumed to predict the future in relation to the amount of change rate, i.e., the model of the nonlinear regression can predict the future.

* So, sets of natural data, for example, daily temperature, daily sunshine duration, and so on, are seemed to be matched with these cases. Cyclical patterns can be described as the result of the revolution of the earth around the sun. Environmental homeostasis of the earth may describe the model of the nonlinear regression.

* One question on this approach. Can economics be applied to this model? I think it's difficult. We need to probe that any cycle in economy is truth. However, economic data tend to have many biases; academic, media, political, and so on.
